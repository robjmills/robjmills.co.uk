My blog has moved again. Over the years i've always had a wordpress blog, at various times hosted on Linode, AWS and most recently at Digital Ocean. However, I so rarely find time to update it, I ended up letting it lapse. Since I became a Dad I don't have much time to think about much so it's taken a back seat. There's a few things though that i'd like to keep online, but I don't really want to pay for the hosting. I've realised recently (hat tip to Mike) that I can keep basic/static sites hosted using Github pages. My plan is to do this moving forwards. With this in mind, it made sense to host the site using [Jekyll][jekyll-docs]. I won't have any hosting costs due to the free hosting supplied using Github pages, and hopefully I can restore my lost content from the web archive.
