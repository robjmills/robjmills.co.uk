I blogged again earlier, for the first time in quite a while. I use Jekyll for my blog which is hosted on Github pages. When I pushed the new post I was greeted by something I hadn't seen before. A warning about security vulnerabilities in my dependencies, in this case the `Gemfile.lock` used by Ruby for dependency management.

I remember [reading about Github doing this](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies) before but i'd never actually seen it. Turns out that Github had found a security issue with a dependency in my `Gemfile.lock`. I updated Jekyll with `bundle update jekyll`, pushed up the changes and the alert was gone. Great work and great feature.
