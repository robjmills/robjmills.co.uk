excerpt: Thanks to Github for having my back

I blogged again earlier, for the first time in quite a while. I use Jekyll for my blog which is hosted on Github pages. When I pushed the new post I was greeted by something I hadn't seen before.

I remember reading about Github doing this before but i'd never actually seen it. Turns out that Github had found a security issue with a dependency in my `Gemfile.lock`. I updated Jekyll with `bundle update jekyll` and it was fixed. Great to know that Gitub has our back here though.
